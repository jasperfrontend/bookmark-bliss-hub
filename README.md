# kies.boo

**A neurospicy-first, keyboard-obsessed personal bookmark tool.**  
No fluff. No bloat. Just speed, structure, and the power to flow.

## What is kies.boo?

**kies.boo** is a fast, minimalist bookmark manager built for neurodivergent brains and power users who live on the keyboard.

Unlike bloated services like Raindrop or clunky browser bookmark bars, kies.boo is designed around:

- Speed of thought interaction  
- Keyboard-first navigation and commands  
- Customizable, user-friendly design 

---

## Why?

Because most bookmark tools aren't made for people like us.

- Too much UI clutter  
- No way to undo mistakes fast  
- Designed for point-and-click behavior, not command-based thinking  
- No dopamine when you batch-clear 15 old bookmarks in 3 seconds

**kies.boo** fixes that.  
It's a productivity playground for the terminal-minded, ADHD-coded, shortcut-slinging kind.

## Keyboard Shortcuts (so far)

Update July: Since @Vuetify has support for keyboard shortcuts now, I'm redoing these to use native shortcuts like ctrl/cmd+s etc.

More to come: command palette, pinned items, "jump to tag", bulk edit, fuzzy search.
